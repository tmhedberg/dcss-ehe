Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (Extra Hearty Edition)
===============================================

This is a fork of the roguelike game *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup*. It is *not* merely a mirror of the [official repository](http://gitorious.org/crawl) on Gitorious, but is a modified version of the "official" game.

Most of these modifications are reverted removals of various game features. The game's development team is a bit too trigger happy on removing mildly imbalanced or even just personally disagreeable features for my tastes. I prefer to favor variety over balance in this style of game, so I regularly review the latest changes to the development version and revert any that I disagree with; this project is the result of those efforts. Many of these changes are just personal preferences; if you don't like them, I recommend playing the (excellent) official version of the game!

The master branch of this repository is regularly rebased onto the updated upstream master branch. Base your own work on it at your own risk.
