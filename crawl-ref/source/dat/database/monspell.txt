# This file contains the messages used to "announce" a spell, like
# "The wizard mumbles some strange words."  The messages are looked
# up in the following order by the following keys:
#
# 1) If the monster is a wizard or priest which has been polymorphed into
#    a wizard without hands which is trying to cast a spell it kept across
#    the polymorph, then the first key will be "polymorphed wizard" or
#    "polymorphed priest".
# 2) The name of the spell being cast:
#   a) If being cast by a wizard or priest monster with arms, first try
#      with the suffix "real".
#   b) If being cast by a monster of normal or higher intelligence with arms,
#      try with the suffix "gestures".
#   c) Next, try without any suffix.
# 3) The name of the monster's type.
# 4) The name of the monster's species.
# 5) The name of the monster's genus.
# 6) "priest" if the monster is a priest type, "wizard" if it's a wizard type,
#    or "demon" if it's demonic.
# 7) If the spell uses a targeted, visible beam, it will try
#    "<beam_short_name> beam cast", then "beam catchall cast".
#
# For 1 and 3 to 6, if the spell has a target it will first add the suffix
# "targeted" to the lookup key before trying without the suffix.
#
# For all lookups, if the monster is unseen by the player it will add the
# prefix "unseen" to the key, or if the player or monster is silenced
# it will prefix "silent" to the key (if the monster is both unseen and
# unheard no message is ever given). If using the prefix "silent" gives
# no results it will try again without the prefix, assuming that the
# spell has no sound component.
#
# To give no message use the string "__NONE", and to skip the current
# lookup method and move onto the next one use the string "__NEXT".
