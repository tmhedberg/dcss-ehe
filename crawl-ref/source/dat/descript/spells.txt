%%%%
Abjuration spell

This spell attempts to send the targeted hostile summoned creature to the place
whence it came, or at least shorten its stay in the caster's locality.
%%%%
Agony spell

This spell cuts the resilience of a target creature in half, although it will
never cause death directly.
%%%%
Airstrike spell

This spell causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling
vortex of meteorological fury. This spell is especially effective against
flying enemies.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication spell

This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol,
confusing all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (although
poison-resistant creatures will suffer no negative effects). It is strongly
focused on the caster, however, and so poison resistance will not protect them.
It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

This spell causes the dead to rise up and serve the caster; every corpse within
sight of the caster is affected. By means of this spell, powerful casters could
press into service an army of the mindless undead. Note that zombies are
incapable of leaving the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Skeleton spell

This spell raises an inert skeleton to a state of unlife, even if that skeleton
is still encased in flesh! Note that skeletons are incapable of leaving the
level they were created on.
%%%%
Apportation spell

This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items
from a distant pile to the floor near the caster. The mass of the target
item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever
be moved by this spell.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist
the pull of this spell.
%%%%
Beastly Appendage spell

This spell makes you temporarily replace one or a pair of appendages with an
animal counterpart, giving you an extra attack. It is not powerful enough to
meld armour.
%%%%
Blade Hands spell

This spell causes long, scythe-shaped blades to grow from the caster's hands.
It makes spellcasting somewhat difficult.
%%%%
Blink spell

This spell randomly translocates the caster a short distance.
%%%%
Bolt of Cold spell

This spell hurls a great bolt of ice and frost.
%%%%
Bolt of Draining spell

This spell hurls a deadly bolt of negative energy, which drains the life from
any living creature it strikes.
%%%%
Bolt of Fire spell

This spell hurls a great bolt of flames.
%%%%
Bolt of Inaccuracy spell

This spell inflicts enormous damage upon any creature struck by the bolt of
incandescent energy conjured into existence. Unfortunately, it is very
difficult to aim and very rarely hits anything. Pity, that.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

This spell hurls a large and heavy metal bolt at the caster's foe.
%%%%
Bolt of Magma spell

This spell hurls a sizzling bolt of molten rock, capable of dealing some
physical damage even to highly fire-resistant enemies.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

This spell instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also
permanently lessens his or her resilience to injury — to a degree dependent on
(and inversely related to) magical skill.

The spell is powerful enough to literally pull someone out of Death's Door,
although the shock will render the caster incapable of action for a while.
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

This spell summons a canine to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

This spell calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell.
%%%%
Cause Fear spell

This spell causes fear in those near to the caster.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

This spell releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs from target to
target until it grounds out. It may ground out harmlessly if there are no
targets sufficiently close to the caster, however.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Degeneration spell

This spell transforms one creature into a pulsating mass of flesh.
%%%%
Condensation Shield spell

This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding
the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore
stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is
controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of
a two-handed weapon.
%%%%
Confuse spell

This spell induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

This spell enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy
is released when the caster touches a monster with their bare hand, and may
induce a state of confusion in the monster.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning. Using the spell is not
without risk — ball lightning can be difficult to control.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

This spell creates a column of roaring flame.
%%%%
Control Teleport spell

This spell allows the caster to control translocations. Be wary that controlled
teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy.
%%%%
Control Undead spell

This spell attempts to enslave any undead in the vicinity of the caster.
%%%%
Controlled Blink spell

This spell allows short-range translocation, with precise control. Be wary that
controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical
energy.
%%%%
Corona spell

This spell causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a
creature. This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and
thereby makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot spell

This spell rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around
the caster, emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at
the life force of any creature it envelops.
%%%%
Cure Poison spell

This spell removes poison from the caster's system.
%%%%
Darkness spell

This spell dims the light of the dungeon, reducing the range of vision. The
area affected is quite large and it doesn't have sharp edges, thus the effect
is unlikely to alert anyone not very close to the caster.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

This spell raises living creatures slain by the caster and his or her allies
into a state of unliving slavery as spectral things.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

This spell is extremely powerful, but carries a degree of risk. It renders
living casters nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but can bring them
dangerously close to death. So close in fact, that the body believes itself to
be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. Being
more skilled at Necromancy leaves the caster more resilient. Undead cannot use
this spell.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

A ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

This spell protects the caster from all kinds of projectile attacks, by slowing
them and somewhat diverting their path. Successfully deflecting an incoming
projectile still requires a reflexive action (your ability to do so is measured
by the Evasion stat), but unlike lesser spells like Repel Missiles, Deflect
Missiles typically makes this so easy that even a drunk plate-clad orc can do
it.
%%%%
Delayed Fireball spell

Successfully casting this spell gives the caster the ability to instantaneously
release a fireball at a later time. Knowing this spell allows the learner to
memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels.
%%%%
Demonic Horde spell

This spell calls forth a small swarm of small demons to do battle with the
caster's foes (and sometimes with each other!).
%%%%
Dig spell

This spell forms tunnels through unworked rock by liquefying it.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

This spell destabilizes the space in a sphere around you for a while, causing
anyone nearby to be randomly blinked. The chance of blinking depends on the
distance from you, being nearly certain when directly adjacent.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

This spell uses the very forces that bind an undead creature together to
inflict a great deal of damage on it.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

This spell tries to teleport away any monsters directly beside the caster.
%%%%
Dragon Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a great, fire-breathing
dragon. Draconian casters will instead retain their innate colour and breath
weapon once transformed.
%%%%
Enslavement spell

This spell causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on your side for a
while.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation spell

This spell tries to lower its target's metabolic rate, inducing hypothermic
hibernation.
%%%%
Evaporate spell

This spell heats a potion to the point that it explodes when thrown. The
resultant steam is then transmuted into a large cloud, the type of which varies
from potion to potion. Of course, the volatile potion must be thrown
immediately for the spell to work.
%%%%
Excruciating Wounds spell

This spell temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence
of pain itself. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to
special enchantments. Note that unlike other brands, pain can not be made
permanent by reading a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
%%%%
Fire Brand spell

This spell sets a weapon or launcher held by the caster ablaze. It will not
affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Fire Storm spell

This spell calls forth a mighty storm of roaring flame directly onto the
target, dealing partially irresistible fire damage in a large area and leaving
behind short-lived fire vortices.
%%%%
Fireball spell

This spell hurls an exploding bolt of fire. This spell does not cost additional
spell levels if the learner already knows Delayed Fireball.
%%%%
Flame Tongue spell

This spell creates a short burst of flame.
%%%%
Flight spell

This spell grants to the caster the ability to fly through the air.
%%%%
Freeze spell

This spell freezes a creature. This may temporarily slow the metabolism of a
cold-blooded creature.
%%%%
Freezing Aura spell

This spell surrounds a weapon or launcher held by the caster with an aura of
freezing cold. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to
special enchantments.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

This spell conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Fulsome Distillation spell

This spell extracts the vile and poisonous essences from a corpse. You probably
don't want to drink the results. The type of potion produced corresponds
roughly to the effects of eating said corpse.
%%%%
Major Healing spell

This spell heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Haste spell

This spell speeds the actions of a creature. Hasting yourself will increase
your magical contamination.
%%%%
Haunt spell

This spell calls wraiths and ghosts to haunt the caster's target. Calling on
the undead exacts a toll on the caster's health, however.
%%%%
Throw Icicle spell

This spell throws forth a shard of ice. It is particularly effective against
those creatures not immune to the effects of freezing. But as most of its
destructive potential comes from strong impact and cutting edges, even
cold-resistant creatures are notably affected.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster's body into a frozen ice-creature,
light enough to float on water.
%%%%
Ice Storm spell

This spell hurls a raging blizzard of ice, sleet and freezing gasses at the
target, dealing partially irresistible cold damage in a large area.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

This spell attempts to convert all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning
poisoned creatures from within. It is very effective against innately poisonous
creatures. The caster is not affected.
%%%%
Inner Flame spell

This spell fills an enemy with an intense fire, to be explosively released upon
death. The size of the explosion caused is dependent on the size of the target.
%%%%
Invisibility spell

This spell hides a creature from the sight of others. While invisible you will
gain magical contamination, which may eventually cause enough glow to make you
visible again.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

This spell throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The sphere will
sometimes explode on impact, and the chance of it doing so is higher if the
sphere has traveled less distance.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

This spell liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move
through. Any attempt to move through the liquefied ground will be a very slow
one.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

This spell fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an
explosion of deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or
any wall-like substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small or medium-sized
explosion. Metal targets will cause a small but particularly damaging
explosion, and targets made from crystal will cause a large and extremely
damaging explosion.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear spell

This spell hurls a lethally sharp bolt of crystal.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

This spell heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Lethal Infusion spell

This spell infuses a weapon held by the caster with unholy energies. It will
not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Levitation spell

This spell allows the caster to float in the air.
%%%%
Lightning Bolt spell

This spell hurls a mighty bolt of lightning. Although this spell inflicts less
damage than similar fire and ice spells, it can at once rip through whole rows
of creatures.
%%%%
Magic Dart spell

This spell hurls a small bolt of magical energy. It never misses.
%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

This spell tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but thankfully
temporary portal to an unknown, tainted otherworld. Which dastardly denizens of
this place might choose to poke their tentacled appendages through, nobody
knows, but certainly nobody would want to be nearby when it happens.
%%%%
Mass Abjuration spell

This spell attempts to send all hostile summoned creatures in sight to the
place whence they came, or at least shorten their stay in the caster's
locality.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

This spell causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

This spell conjures up a large but short-lived cloud of vile fumes.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

This spell tries to lower the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's
vicinity, slowing all those who are not resistant to cold. It bypasses magic
resistance, although tougher monsters will not be slowed for as long as others.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

This spell first transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal
figure. The caster gains some powers of death, and becomes more resistant to
cold and hostile enchantments and completely immune to poison, rotting, and
negative energy, and requires no food at all for the duration of the spell.

The caster also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having an undead
body, such as a vulnerability to holy weapons and an inability to consume
potions.

Contrary to what one would expect, this spell works on octopodes, although what
foul necromantic tissue serves as an analogue for bones remains a mystery.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

This spell bathes the caster's surroundings in a sickly green light, inflicting
poison on everything nearby (including the caster). It can be blocked by
translucent walls, however, and invisible creatures are completely unaffected.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

This spell conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most
other projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home
onto their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile
opponents may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to
stabilize, and a nascent orb won't do the full damage it is capable of.

It is said that most copies of this spell suffer from a scribal error that
makes the orbs unstable beyond a short range. Certain individuals may have
access to spellbooks without this flaw, so beware!
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

This spell envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of ice, the power
of which depends on his or her skill with ice magic. The caster and the
caster's equipment will not suffer cold from this layer, yet can be affected by
other sources of cold normally. The spell will not function for casters already
wearing heavy armour (any body armour with an evasion penalty of 2 or more).
The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in ice form.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

This spell drains the heat from the caster and his or her surroundings, causing
harm to all creatures not resistant to cold.
%%%%
Pain spell

This spell inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The
caster suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

This spell prevents a creature from moving.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

This spell opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow
instantaneous transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering
them. There is no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time,
but a gateway will close when entered or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through
solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it takes time for the caster to attune
to the rock, during which time they will be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

This spell attempts to petrify a monster. If successful, the monster is slowed
down for a while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, a
monster will take less damage upon being hit. It also precludes the use of
wings, which can be quite unhealthy above lava.
%%%%
Phase Shift spell

This spell allows the caster to phase in and out of the material plane,
allowing them to occasionally avoid blows entirely.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

This spell hurls a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin.
No living thing is completely immune to its effects, and even the undead will
take damage from the physical component of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Weapon spell

This spell temporarily coats any weapon or launcher with poison. It will only
work on weapons without an existing enchantment.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

This spell conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gasses.
%%%%
Polymorph Other spell

This spell randomly alters the form of another creature. It is especially
effective against shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

This spell teleports a fired or thrown missile directly to its target, greatly
increasing its accuracy (but not damage).
%%%%
Recall spell

This spell is greatly prized by summoners and necromancers, as it allows the
caster to recall any friendly creatures nearby to a position adjacent to the
caster.
%%%%
Regeneration spell

This spell reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unholy act
dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's recuperative abilities,
while also increasing the rate of food consumption.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

This spell reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, by
making them significantly easier to dodge.
%%%%
Ring of Flames spell

This spell surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps
other fire clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the
forces of fire, increasing their fire magic and giving protection from fire.
However, it also makes them much more susceptible to the forces of ice.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when
the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can
with whatever ambient grit is available.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

This spell weaves a creature from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter. The
creature thus brought into existence will recreate some type of creature found
in the caster's immediate vicinity. The spell even creates appropriate
equipment for the creature, which are given a lasting substance by their firm
contact with reality.
%%%%
Shatter spell

This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will
damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal, crystal or
otherwise brittle material will particularly suffer. The magic has been known to
adversely affect walls.
%%%%
Shock spell

This spell throws a bouncing bolt of electricity.
%%%%
Shroud of Golubria spell

This spell bends space along a shroud covering your body, protecting you from
some blows by redirecting their force to the air around you. Ranged attacks
move too quickly to be diverted in this way. The shroud is highly unstable and
may fall apart unexpectedly under stress.
%%%%
Silence spell

This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls,
casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible.
(Applies to caster too, of course.) This spell will not hide your presence,
since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living
creature that something is very wrong.

Silence starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before the effect times out. Some
creatures, such as demons, cast magic without speaking and so will be
unaffected, and those with innate magical abilities will also still be able to
use them.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

This spell uses a piece of flesh in hand to create a replica of the original
being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will
sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small
puddle of water first. Note that simulacra are incapable of leaving the level
they were created on.
%%%%
Slow spell

This spell slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a swift, venomous (but
poison-susceptible), spider-like creature. Spellcasting is slightly more
difficult in this form. While in this form, you can cling to walls.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

This spell releases electric charges against those next to the caster. These
may arc to adjacent monsters (or even the caster) before they eventually ground
out.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a slow-moving (but extremely
robust) stone statue, capable of dealing monstrous blows with weapons or bare
fists. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, rotting and negative energy.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes spell

This spell uses wooden items in the caster's grasp as raw material for a
powerful transmutation. Note that magical artefacts will not be affected.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

This spell conjures a sticky glob of liquid fire, which will adhere to and burn
any creature it strikes.
%%%%
Sting spell

This spell throws a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

This spell hurls a sharp spine of rock outward from the caster.
%%%%
Stoneskin spell

This spell hardens one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth
Magic. It only works on relatively normal flesh, and will aid neither the
undead nor the bodily transformed. However, there is one exception: the effects
of this spell will be boosted for casters in Statue Form.
%%%%
Striking spell

This spell hurls a small bolt of force.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

This spell converts flesh, blood and other bodily fluids into magical energy.
Casters may focus this spell on their own bodies (which can be dangerous but
never directly lethal) or can wield freshly butchered flesh in order to draw
power into themselves.
%%%%
Summon Butterflies spell

This spell creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%
Summon Demon spell

This spell opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its
inhabitants to serve the caster for a time (although the demon's servitude is
by no means guaranteed).
%%%%
Summon Dragon spell

This spell summons and binds a powerful dragon to perform the caster's bidding.
%%%%
Summon Elemental spell

This spell calls forth a spirit from the elemental planes to aid the caster. A
large quantity of the desired element must be available; this is rarely a
problem for earth and air, but may be for fire or water. The elemental will
usually be friendly to casters — especially those skilled in the appropriate
form of elemental magic.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

This spell calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the
caster. Beware, for the spell binding it to service may not outlast that which
binds it to this world!
%%%%
Summon Horrible Things spell

This spell opens a gate to the Abyss and calls through one or more hideous
abominations from that dreadful place. The powers who answer this invocation
require of casters a portion of their intellect in exchange for this service.
%%%%
Summon Hydra spell

This spell summons a many-headed hydra to fight alongside the caster for a
short time.
%%%%
Summon Ice Beast spell

This spell calls forth a beast of ice to serve the caster.
%%%%
Summon Scorpions spell

This spell summons one or more scorpions (some of which may not be bound to the
caster's service).
%%%%
Summon Small Mammals spell

This spell summons one or two small creatures to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Summon Swarm spell

This spell summons forth a pestilential swarm.
%%%%
Summon Ugly Thing spell

This spell summons a mutated otherworldly creature to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Sure Blade spell

This spell forms a mystical bond between the caster and a wielded short blade,
making the blade much easier to use.
%%%%
Swiftness spell

This spell imbues its caster with the ability to achieve great movement speeds.
But this speed comes at a price: the caster is less stealthy and more likely to
blunder into traps while the spell is in effect.
%%%%
Teleport Other spell

This spell randomly translocates another creature.
%%%%
Throw Flame spell

This spell throws a small bolt of flame.
%%%%
Throw Frost spell

This spell throws a small bolt of frost.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

This spell creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tornado spell

This spell turns the air around the caster in a mighty vortex, doing tremendous
damage to everyone caught in it. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and
it follows the caster. Everything not firmly nailed down will be lifted and
tossed around.

The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas.

As a side effect, this spell may be used to cross lava, but beware of its short
duration.
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

This spell causes a weapon held in the caster's hand to dance into the air and
strike the caster's enemies. It will not function on certain wilful artefacts;
any abilities that require evocation skill won't be used either.
%%%%
Twisted Resurrection spell

This spell causes nearby corpses to begin crawling together, merging into
horrible agglomerations of flesh. More and larger corpses result in more
powerful creations.
%%%%
Vampiric Draining spell

This spell steals the life of a living creature and grants it to the caster.
Life will not be drained in excess of what the caster can capably absorb.

However, attempting to drain an undead or demonic creature will backfire on the
caster.
%%%%
Venom Bolt spell

This spell throws a bolt of poison.
%%%%
Warp Weapon spell

This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon.
Note that unlike other brands, distortion can not be made permanent by reading
a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
%%%%
