%%%%
A Zot trap

This trap bears a powerful enchantment that inflicts dangerously unpredictable
magical effects on those unlucky enough to trigger it. It's often worse than
mere damage — you may find yourself thrown into the Abyss, contaminated with
enormous amounts of wild magic, have mighty fiends summoned against you, or the
like — it is something to avoid at all costs.
%%%%
A basalt altar of Yredelemnul

An altar to Yredelemnul the Dark, worked from columnar basalt.
%%%%
A blade trap

You can see the edge of a massive scythe-like blade hidden in a slit; it
probably has a counterweight that acts as a pendulum.

giants and covered with bloodstains.
%%%%
A blossoming altar of Fedhas

An altar to Fedhas Madash, covered in vibrant and colourful plant life.
%%%%
A bolt trap

A well-concealed hole containing a crossbow-like contraption with a
self-loading mechanism. Beware of its bolts, as a steel construction can reach
draw forces far above those of a living arbalester.
%%%%
A broken pillar

The makers of this pillar were overrun long ago. No one alive remembers why
they built it.
%%%%
A burning altar of Makhleb

An ever-burning altar to Makhleb the Destroyer. Strange, twisting shapes are
visible in the flames.
%%%%
A closed door

A wooden door. To open it, try simply walking into it, or press 'O'.
%%%%
# These should get custom names instead. Currently used by: IceCv, Ossuary,

This passage was apparently shoddily made, and cannot be used anymore.
%%%%
A corrupted altar of Lugonu

An altar to Lugonu the Unformed, possibly dedicated to some other power before
it was irrevocably corrupted.
%%%%
A crawl-hole back to the Lair

This passage leads back to less cramped spaces with fewer cobwebs.
%%%%
A dart trap

This trap can shoot relatively weak spikes of metal. They are unlikely to kill
anyone outright, but may be enough to put down someone who's running half-dead
while chased by some monster.
%%%%
A deep blue altar of Sif Muna

An altar of the deepest blue, covered in intricate patterns and writings in
long forgotten scripts, devoted to Sif Muna the Loreminder.

A detected altar

An altar of some kind. If you wish to know what deity it is consecrated to,
you'll have to come closer.
%%%%
# mmap/antennae/etc
A detected shop or portal

A gateway of some kind. You can't tell where it leads without approaching
nearer.
%%%%
A dry fountain

A dried-up fountain that has seen better days.

though...
%%%%
A fountain of blood

Press 'q' to drink from this fountain, if you absolutely wish to.
%%%%
A fountain of sparkling water

%%%%
A gate leading to another region of Pandemonium

This gate leads to yet another region of Pandemonium. There'll always be more.
%%%%
A one-way gate leading to the halls of Pandemonium

This gate leads to the endless halls of Pandemonium. Tales about successful
lootings of these netherworlds are rare. Even the strongest and most
experienced characters can die there. On the other hand, these halls contain
several runes and lots of valuable items. It is much easier to get in than to
get out.
%%%%
A gas trap

You're lucky to have noticed this trap, for it would have released a cloud of
deadly gas at you. Exactly what gas it holds, you cannot tell — perhaps it is
plain poison, perhaps mutagenic fumes, perhaps flammable vapour, or perhaps
something yet nastier.
%%%%
A gas trap:quote

“Good your grace, an’ I had room for such a thundergust within mine ancient
bowels, ’tis not in reason I coulde discharge ye same and live to thank God for
yt. He did choose handmaid so humble whereby to shew his power. Nay, ’tis not I
yt have broughte forth this rich o’ermastering fog, this fragrant gloom, so
pray you seeke ye further.”
    -Mark Twain, “1601”, 1880.
%%%%
A gate to the Depths

This gate leads to the Depths — the deepest parts of the dungeon, subject to
the corrupting influence of the Realm of Zot and its denizens.
%%%%
A gate to the Realm of Zot

This gate leads to the Realm of Zot, the final stage of your quest as its
deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot. Both the Orb and this Realm have
a fearsome and questionable reputation, but one piece of information seems to
be certain: The monsters inhabiting this area and protecting the Orb are strong
and strange — some of them encountered nowhere but here.
%%%%
A gateway back into the Dungeon

This gate allows a feat popularly thought to be impossible: escaping Hell
alive.
%%%%
A gateway leading out of the Abyss

A gateway out of this accursed place, shimmering and shifting in the
impermanent landscape.
%%%%
A gateway leading deeper into the Abyss

A strangely calm gateway amid the roiling landscape. It leads further into the
depths of the abyss.
%%%%
A gateway to a ziggurat

This portal leads to an ancient ziggurat, a place of untold challenges and
untold riches.

The portal is usable just once, and there's a large monetary fee to be paid.
%%%%
A gateway to the ashen valley of Gehenna

You can feel the heat. Gehenna seems to be made out of nothing but flames, lava
and hellfire.
%%%%
A gateway to Hell

This gateway leads to the Vestibule of Hell. Few would go there voluntarily.
%%%%
A gateway to the Iron City of Dis

Who will stand the test of iron?
%%%%
A gateway to the decaying netherworld of Tartarus

This place seems to radiate negative energy.
%%%%
A gateway to the freezing wastes of Cocytus

From the frost-bitten lands, a cold chill touches your soul.

A gleaming silver wall

This wall, made of pure silver, was formed by the power of Zin to imprison a
monster within its confines. It is quickly crumbling, and will not last long.
%%%%
A glowing golden altar of the Shining One

An altar to the Shining One, made from the purest gold and almost blinding in
its radiance.
%%%%
A glowing silver altar of Zin

An altar to Zin the Law-Giver, made from silver as pristine as Zin's followers
are expected to be, and glowing gently.
%%%%
A granite statue

Despite the hardness of the stone, this statue's features have long withered
away.
%%%%
A hole to the Spider Nest

This is more of a natural sloped shaft than a stairway, but it will do. If you
want to die from the most potent venoms of this world, that is.
%%%%
A labyrinth entrance

A gateway to an intricate maze designed by subtle and malicious minds, its exit
guarded by a fearsome monster. Many a hapless adventurer has lost his way in
the twisted, shifting passages, and starved to death.
%%%%
A mangrove

This tree is specially adapted for growing in swampy conditions. Its vines are
too thick to see through.

While too large to be felled with an axe, it is susceptible to bolts of
lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of fire.
%%%%
A mechanical trap

A mechanical contraption designed to harm trespassers. A skilled adventurer can
try to disarm it, though.
%%%%
A metal wall

A wall of bluish-grey metal. As every dungeon electrician knows, this stuff
will ground.
%%%%
A needle trap

It is damn sure the needles from this trap are doused in something nasty.
%%%%
A net trap

A large concealed net is hanging from the dungeon's ceiling, with a string
attached and rigged to make it fall onto anyone who trips it.
%%%%
A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

A one-way gate to a demon-haunted realm, riven by chaos, its very substance
impermanent and whimsical, filled with creatures out of nightmare. Easy to
enter, difficult to leave.
%%%%
A passage of Golubria

This unstable gateway allows instantaneous travel to another nearby passage of
Golubria, and will close behind anything passing through it.
%%%%
A portal to somewhere

A gash-like tear in reality that looks into some terrifying, starry otherworld.
Thankfully, the magic that opened this portal prevents its vacuum from
consuming and swallowing everything in sight.
%%%%
A pressure plate

One of the floor stones doesn't seem that sturdy, and you notice that it is a
trigger of some sort, although you can't tell what kind of trap it is attached
to.
%%%%
A radiant altar of Vehumet

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive
powers to those who would follow Vehumet.
%%%%
A rock wall

This wall consists of simple rock.
%%%%
A rock-blocked tunnel

The way you came in doesn't seem to be passable anymore.
%%%%
A rocky tunnel leading out of this place

An unstable passage in the volcanic rock, admitting a draft of cool air from
beyond.
%%%%
A roughly hewn altar of Beogh

An altar to Beogh, unmistakably roughly hewn by orcish artisans.
%%%%
A runed door

A door, covered in runic writing. It looks like there is something special
behind it — perhaps danger, perhaps treasure. You may break the runes and open
it like any other door (i.e., by walking into it or pressing 'O').
%%%%
A sealed door

A door sealed tightly by arcane runes. It refuses to open for any creature not
recognised by its magic.
%%%%
A sealed passage leading down

A descending passage sealed tightly by a magical barricade. Forcing your way
through it looks impossible, so long as the magic holds.
%%%%
A sealed passage leading up

An ascending passage sealed tightly by a magical barricade. Forcing your way
through it looks impossible, so long as the magic holds.
%%%%
A shaft

A deep hole. Who knows where you might end up if you were to fall through it?
%%%%
A shattered altar of Ashenzari

This crystal altar shattered to pieces when Ashenzari was cursed. But still,
there is power here: a dark aura holds the shards in mid-explosion, suspended
in time and space much like the god they herald.
%%%%
A shimmering altar of Xom

This altar constantly shimmers in all visible colours and probably some
invisible ones, too, matching the whims of Xom the Unpredictable, to whom it is
dedicated.
%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive
and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with, grants no refunds, and
is interested in nothing you may have to sell. Some shops hawk antiques of
unknown provenance, and offer little hint as to the quality or nature of their
goods.
%%%%
A slime covered rock wall

This rock wall is thickly coated with bright green slime. Ewwwwww. It is acidic
to the touch, seeming to grow more caustic the deeper you travel.
%%%%
A snail-covered altar of Cheibriados

This altar somehow seems more stationary than the others.
%%%%
A sparkling altar of Nemelex Xobeh

This altar sparkles with a lightshow brighter than any gambling den's to
attract followers for Nemelex Xobeh.
%%%%
A spawn point

Here's one of the entrances that the opposition may come in through.
%%%%
A spear trap

This trap shoots long sharp poles that can skewer tresspassers.
%%%%
A staircase back to the Dungeon

These stairs lead back up to the familiarity of the dungeon.
%%%%
A staircase back to the Lair

These stairs lead back up to the Lair of Beasts.
%%%%
A staircase back to the Mines

These wide stairs lead back to the Orcish Mines.
%%%%
A staircase back to the Vaults

These stairs lead back to the mighty Vaults.
%%%%
A staircase leading out of the dungeon

This exit leads to the Big Blue Room. Sky, singing birds, fresh air — that kind
of stuff. Also taxes and whatever else you ran from.

Climbing these stairs will end your quest, whether you carry the Orb with you
or not.
%%%%
A staircase out of the Tomb

These stairs lead back out of this accursed place.
%%%%
A staircase to the Crypt

These stairs lead to an ancient crypt. Unfortunately, not everything that was
buried there had the decency to stay dead.
%%%%
A staircase to the Ecumenical Temple

An entrance to a temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity
of the dungeon.
%%%%
A staircase to the Elven Halls

A wide stair down to the murky depths of the halls of the deep elves, skilled
warriors with blades and bows, and fearsome sorcerers and magicians.
%%%%
A staircase to the Hall of Blades

These stairs lead to the Hall of Blades. The steps seem to have been beaten and
chipped by assaults from the animated weapons therein.
%%%%
A staircase to the Lair

These stairs lead down to the Lair of Beasts, for a change of climate.
%%%%
A staircase to the Orcish Mines

An entrance to the mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but treacherous
and easy to get trapped in.
%%%%
A staircase to the Dwarven Hall

An entrance to the well-worked hall of the dwarves. You think you can smell
ale.
%%%%
A staircase to the Enchanted Forest

On the other end of these stairs lies the wooded home of spriggans, tengu,
fauns, and all manner of terrifying hexes.
%%%%
A staircase to the Shoals

Here be the Shoals: exotic underground beaches, salty spray and creatures that
bite, stab and maul.
%%%%
A staircase to the Slime Pits

An entrance to the amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes.
%%%%
A staircase to the Snake Pit

Here is the way to the home of the serpent, the lair of the naga.
%%%%
A staircase to the Swamp

A stair to a swampy wasteland, complete with ooze, muck, flies and large
slavering carnivorous monsters.
%%%%
A staircase to the Tomb

A way to the Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors animated by
the vilest necromancy.
%%%%
A staircase to the Vaults

These stairs lead down into the Vaults, said to be home to great treasures.
They are sprinkled with spots of blood.
%%%%
A stone staircase leading down

These stairs lead further down.
%%%%
A stone staircase leading up

These stairs lead back up.
%%%%
A stone wall

A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone
walls.
%%%%
A short-range portal

Stepping on this teleporter will send you to another room.
%%%%
A teleport trap

This magical trap can displace anyone hapless enough to step on it — or even
fly above it — to a random place on the same dungeon level.
%%%%
A translucent rock wall

The mineral this rock consists of is as translucent as good quality glass.
Whether it is natural or magical, you can't tell.
%%%%
A translucent stone wall

A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone
walls. It has been imbued with arcane magics which render it translucent.
%%%%
A translucent unnaturally hard rock wall

This wall is imbued with magic that not only makes it indestructible but also
makes it translucent like glass.
%%%%
A tree

While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not
bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are
spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can
grow underground.

While too large to be felled with an axe, it is susceptible to bolts of
lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of fire.
%%%%
A viscous altar of Jiyva

A slimy, ever-shifting altar to Jiyva. You're not sure what it's made from, and
you don't really want to know.
%%%%
A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this
polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction,
and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
A wall of the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium

This wall is made from the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium, but seems to
be like rock in most other aspects.
%%%%
A white marble altar of Elyvilon

An altar to Elyvilon the Healer, made from purest white marble and topped by a
sculpture of the Chalice of Purification.
%%%%
A web

The spider who left this web must have been huge, as it seems to be made for
trapping {{ return you.genus(true) }} rather than flies.
%%%%
An abandoned shop

This shop has been abandoned.
%%%%
An alarm trap

While this trap does no damage by itself, its loud sound may bring someone to
do damage to you. Of course, you have the option to do damage to those someones
yourself.
%%%%
An ancient bone altar of Kikubaaqudgha

Ancient bones were piled here to form an altar to the terrible Demon-God
Kikubaaqudgha.
%%%%
An arrow trap

You can see several bowstrings and arrows attached to fixed bow-like things.
Typically, in a trap like this, only one is released every time the trigger is
tripped. Such a trap is cheaper and easier to make than an auto-loading
mechanism and a steel bow with the monstrous draw force of a bolt trap, so
don't expect enormous damage. Still, a mere arrow through the artery is enough
to kill a person.
%%%%
An empty arch of ancient stone

A stone archway that seems to have stood here forever and doesn't seem to lead
anywhere in particular.
%%%%
An escape hatch in the ceiling

A spring-loaded one-way escape hatch set in the ceiling.
%%%%
An escape hatch in the floor

A spring-loaded one-way escape hatch set in the dungeon floor, allowing the
adventurer beset by adversaries to exchange the perils of this level for the
perils of the next.
%%%%
An exit through the horrors of the Abyss

If you ever wanted to escape out of the pan into the fire, this is your chance.
This gateway allows you to return from this place via a nice scenic path
through infinite madness.

%%%%
An iron altar of Okawaru

An altar of iron and steel dedicated to the Warmaster Okawaru. Its edges are
surprisingly sharp.
%%%%
An iron grate

This iron grate looks rusted, as if it could be disrupted with a spell or a
wand quite easily. It's too strong to be breakable by hand, though.
%%%%
An open door

A wooden door. You can close it by standing next to it and {{
    if crawl.is_tiles() then
        return "either doing Ctrl-L-Click on the door or pressing 'C'."
    else
        return "pressing 'C'."
    end

%%%%
An orcish idol

An idol of the orc god Beogh. Destroying it is likely to incur Beogh's wrath.
%%%%
An unnaturally hard rock wall

You cannot affect this wall by any means.
%%%%
The endless lava

A sea of fire and brimstone that goes as far as you can see. Which is not far
because of thick smoke.

Unlike small pools of lava where flight may allow short trips, floating above
this inferno would cook you in no time thanks to runaway convection.
%%%%
The floor

A well-worn stone floor made of closely fitted granite flagstones that were
hewn and set untold ages ago by long-forgotten hands.
%%%%
Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would attempt to
set foot into it, apart from those able to fly or swim. Be warned: many
confused adventurers have met their death in the depths, and an unexpected end
of flight has drowned even more careless interlopers.
%%%%
Some lava

An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This cloudy, waist-deep water makes movement and combat cumbersome for
landlubbers — this is sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
%%%%
The open sea

Nothing but endless wind and waves, and not a lighthouse in sight. You'd be
lost beyond all hope in short order — better not risk it.

though, so be sure to do all your pillaging first.
%%%%
# wizlab: Wucad Mu
An autumnal tree

These trees, large as they are, appear to be permanently locked in an autumnal
moment: leaves, coloured red and gold, fall from branches and float gracefully
to the floor. Before they even reach the ground, however, a shadow passes, and
when the shimmer is gone, the leaves are once more on the branch, ready to fall
again.
%%%%
A crumbled stone wall

These walls, though they have fallen into disrepair, appear as locked in time
as the trees, ready to collapse, but utterly unable to.
%%%%
A strange statue

The features of this statue are strange and alien. Is it because the statue is
worn and tarnished that it has become so unrecognisable? Or is it that the
subject was something demonic and evil?

Though a thousand feet may have trod these floors, they appear timeless and
indestructible.

Perhaps it is the humidity, or the constant flow of clouds, but the floor here

# Ice Cave
An ice choked empty arch of ancient stone

It looks like the way you came in has been unused for ages. The portal is not
only old and inoperative, but also nearly completely encased in a mass of ice.

Fortunately, you can see another portal shimmering nearby.
%%%%
An ice covered gate leading back out of here

A still-working portal is standing here. Its magic is holding the ice at bay,
preventing it from completely blocking the gate. You are quite certain that you
won't be able to return here after you pass through it, though, so you'd better
explore this place first.

Or, perhaps, escape with your life before you freeze into an ugly-looking
icicle.
%%%%
An ice covered rock wall

The rock here is covered by a thick layer of frost and ice. Since you can see
liquid water dripping in places, it is obvious how this cave came to be: water
seeped into cracks in the rock and then froze, slowly delving the place you're
in. And so it delves on your remaining body heat.
%%%%
Some ice crusted deep water

The ice here is broken into pieces, and the water it floats on doesn't look
inviting in the slightest.

Some ice crusted shallow water

It looks freezing, but if you don't mind hypothermia, you can probably wade
through it.

A permanent cold front seems to surround this portal. Whatever lives on the
other side will be full of grim and arctic fury. You note that the archway is
melting away.
%%%%
A sand-covered staircase

You can make out a staircase leading downwards into a small tomb. Sand
surrounds the staircase and is continuously pouring onto it. Before long, the
staircase will be gone. They say that some distant relatives of the pharaohs
were entombed here.
%%%%
A glowing drain

A glowing drain entrance from which emanates the stench of excrement. It seems
to be rusting and clogging up fairly rapidly.
%%%%
A portal to a secret trove of treasure

A sumptuously worked golden gate that leads to a very rich trove of valuable
items. The price of entry is not low.
%%%%
A dark tunnel

Leading directly into the rock is a dark and forbidding tunnel. Every so often,
air hot enough to singe your face blasts from within, and, as though triggered
by the air, rocks fall from the roof and sides of the tunnel, slowly filling
the entry.
%%%%
A magical portal

This portal has been left open by a careless wizard. It might lead to a secret
laboratory, but beware! Surely it will be guarded by magical traps and terrible
monsters. It seems to be slowly fading away.

An open sea?

Though it exists in stark defiance of every conventional rule of physics and
geometry you know to be true, there can be no denying that here, in this tiny
room, is a vast and terrible sea of impossible size.

Either that, or it's a blue wall.
