%%%%
air elemental fan

elemental magic.
%%%%

This amulet protects its wearer from some forms of mental confusion, including
being infuriated against one's will.
%%%%
amulet of conservation

This amulet protects some of the possessions of its wearer from outright
destruction, but not infallibly so.

monsters via ranged attacks or spells.

This amulet repels some of the attacks of creatures which have been magically
summoned, and also makes the wearer more resistant to draining attacks.
%%%%
amulet of faith

This is a talisman crafted to call the attention of the gods to its wearer.
This divine attention makes it easier to please your god, but your god is also
less likely to forgive your transgressions, and the amulet will drain some of
your divine favour when removed.
%%%%
amulet of stasis

An amulet meticulously constructed with magical wards to block magical and
physiological effects that would otherwise teleport, slow, haste, or paralyse
its wearer.

While the amulet is effective against most translocular magic, plane shifts
such as banishment are beyond its ability to block.
%%%%

%%%%
book of air

blown by a stiff breeze; at other times, the pages are stuck together by static
electricity, and throw off brief sparks as they are separated.
%%%%
book of alchemy

A book focusing on alchemical processes and their use in magic spells,
collecting the wisdom of many ancient alchemists. When the book is opened, the
text is revealed as the ink condenses from the air onto the pages.
%%%%
book of annihilations

Blood leaks from the tattered pages of this book, and even an illiterate will
feel the sheer impact of arcane fury contained within. It is sought after by
sorcerers, for it allows the gifted and resourceful to command destruction with
ease. Feeble wizards, however, may well meet their doom when trying to read this
opus.
%%%%
book of beasts

A book of spells focused on the magical production of beasts, with pages made
from animal skins and covers lined with teeth. It reeks of a zoo, and will
occasionally nip at the fingers of careless readers.
%%%%
book of burglary

A book containing many diverse spells useful for theft, breaking and entering,
and other miscellaneous larceny. Sorcerers who let their attention lapse while
reading from this tome will occasionally turn a page to find that some small
item from their pockets has been pilfered and placed between the pages.
%%%%
book of callings

An introductory text on the magical Summoning of beasts and beings from other
realms. Tiny flies and gnats seem to pop up out of nowhere when the book is
opened, and then vanish when the book is closed.
%%%%
book of cantrips

A book containing a small selection of very basic magic spells, intended for
beginners who wish to learn the rudiments of one of the featured magical
schools. Nonetheless, even experienced mages can still find use for the spells
contained therein.
%%%%
book of changes

A student's primer to the magic arts of Transmutations, with many lavish
illustrations from the school's early experimental history:
half-wizard-half-Spiders, wizards with Blade Noses, or beaked tentacles instead
of legs. The text is full of reassurances that this kind of thing doesn't
happen anymore, though some potential Transmuters decide to take up Charms
instead.
%%%%
book of clouds

A book of magic spells for creating an assortment of clouds, sheathed in a fine
mist that sometimes makes the words appear a bit hazy. An insightful book,
though occasionally the author gets sidetracked into boring discussions about
what objects the cloud diagrams look like.
%%%%
book of conjurations

A book containing an introduction to the destructive magical arts of
Conjurations. It shudders with barely-contained power when it is opened.
%%%%
book of control

A book of magic spells for controlling minds, bodies, and even space. Wizards
who see the book lying around may feel a compulsion to browse through its
pages, and those who do sometimes find it hard to take their minds off the
sigils and runes inside.
%%%%
book of death

A ghoulishly illuminated manuscript containing dark spells of Necromancy,
written with inks distilled from corpses. Each page is filled with grotesque
art depicting scenes of disgusting decay and horrifying death, with much of the
text incorporated into the drawings as coils of entrails or arrangements of
bone.
%%%%
book of debilitation

A book containing Hexes useful for an Arcane Marksman. Many of the pages inside
are filled with holes, as if they had been used as archery targets before being
inscribed and bound. This occult technique supposedly gives the spells an
affinity for being used with ranged weapons, though, in practice, they appear
to work no differently from the variants found in less-perforated texts.
%%%%
book of dreams

A record of the somniloquent utterings of an entranced mystic, describing a
number of spells reflecting the mystic's dream state. Critics of the work argue
that the spells are functionally no different from ones already known, but the
book remains popular for its uniquely bizarre imagery and cryptic digressions.
%%%%
book of enchantments

A spellbook containing an assortment of magical Hexes and Charms, which
sparkles and shimmers as the pages are flipped. The quaintly anachronistic
title reflects an earlier, more incomplete arcane understanding of these two
schools of magic.
%%%%
book of envenomations

A book of magic spells, glowing with a sickly green light. This book was first
written by Olgreb, the infamous Venom Mage, who murdered many of his rivals by
sending them highly poisonous copies as gifts. Current editions are harmless,
though often dead bookworms and silverfish are found stuck between the pages.
%%%%
book of fixed level

A book of magic spells.
%%%%
book of fixed theme

A book of magic spells.
%%%%
book of fire

A book, containing advanced spells in the elemental school of Fire. Many Fire
Elementalists have had their eyebrows and beards singed off by the momentary
flame that issues forth when the book is first opened, and some have even found
that, when left unattended for months, it can spontaneously combust,
occasionally burning down whole libraries in terrible conflagrations.
%%%%
book of flames

The standard text used in arcane academies by students of the elemental magic
of Fire. It is quite warm to the touch, and its edges are singed. The pages are
inscribed with sigils of flame that glow with flickering light to read by.
%%%%
book of frost

A book of magic spells, often used as an introduction to the elemental magics
of Ice. The cover is cold to the touch, and the mystic runes are written in a
flowing, jagged style, reminiscent of frost covering a window.
%%%%
book of geomancy

A book containing basic spells involving the element of Earth. It feels quite
dense, though no heavier than other spellbooks. When read, little bits of grit
spill from the pages, which appear to be made of thin sheets of mica.
%%%%
book of hinderance

A mystic manual dedicated to the art of slowing the minds and bodies of one's
foes, written in a cramped, nearly incomprehensible script on very rigid pages
that don't turn easily. Some wizards report a stiffness in their fingers while
they read, which goes away when the book is closed.
%%%%
book of ice

A book of advanced magical spells using the element of Ice. The book is
freezing cold, and the pages are covered in flaky bits of frost. Even though
they wear warm clothing, the scribes who write copies of this tome often suffer
frostbite or hypothermia.
%%%%
book of maledictions

This spellbook teaches Enchanters how to weaken and confound their enemies with
Hexes before finishing them off. The frontispiece contains a depiction of an
evil eye, an ancient cursed symbol; this has occasioned numerous tales of
adventurers who met bad ends after carrying this book into the dungeon. Though,
as sceptics point out, pretty much everybody who enters the dungeon meets a bad
end.
%%%%
book of minor magic

A spellbook containing a variety of simple but useful magical incantations.
Many prominent spellcasters used this book to begin their arcane studies. First
published three centuries ago, it is one of the most well-known grimoires in
the world, and is currently on its eighty-eighth printing.
%%%%
book of morphology

A book dedicated to Transmutations of form. The text is constantly changing and
shifting, making it nearly impossible to use a table of contents or a bookmark.
Still, most sorcerers manage to find what they are looking for in its pages.
%%%%
book of necromancy

A macabre book of magic spells, often the very first grimoire a beginning
Necromancer will learn from. Considering the hazards that can come with
dabbling in necromantic magic, this is also sometimes the very *last* grimoire
a beginning Necromancer will study.
%%%%
book of party tricks

This book contains a number of fun spells guaranteed to liven up any wizarding
party, as well as a number of toasts, jokes, and party games, all written in
bright colours and funny scripts. The spells in this book have been adjusted
slightly so they can be sung to the tunes of popular drinking songs.
%%%%
book of power

A book of powerful magic spells, coveted by ambitious wizards who seek to gain
ascendance over their rivals. It crackles and shudders with barely-contained
energies.
%%%%
book of spatial translocations

The classic text of the magical field of Translocations, written by the
archmage and accomplished Warper Golubria two centuries ago. This book can
still be found in magical libraries all across the world, although sometimes
not on the same shelf where the librarian left it.
%%%%
book of summonings

An advanced treatise on Summoning magics, detailing ways of summoning and
binding creatures from all manners of horrible realms. There are a number of
dire warnings with graphic illustrations of the dangers of summoning such
monsters, since not all of them will be friendly.
%%%%
book of the dragon

A magical book of spells which allow some command over dragons and their
aspects. The book is warm to the touch, bound in a scaly sort of leather, and
every page has a lavish illustration of a different variety of dragon, both
real and imaginary.
%%%%
book of the earth

A textbook for experienced Earth Elementalists. It has an aura of incredible
density, making those who look upon it feel as though they are standing under
hundreds of tons of rock, even when really under the open sky.
%%%%
book of the sky

A magical book containing powerful elemental spells of Air. The scribes who
produce copies of this grimoire are sequestered in high towers in the plains,
to better attune themselves to the forces of Air, and the coruscating runes are
written in flickering lightning.
%%%%
book of the tempests

This book contains magic spells which command some of the most destructive
forces of nature. When opened, lightning crackles between the pages, winds gust
against the reader's face, and the whole book shakes with violent tremors.
%%%%
book of the warp

A book of Translocations spells for experienced Warpers. Its shimmering pages
exist in multiple dimensions at once, not all of which obey the usual rules of
geometry. Some pages disappear when they're turned, while others appear out of
nowhere, and others pass directly through the other pages or themselves. Some
of the pages have three sides, or only one, or have fractional numbers of
corners. The effect can be disconcerting.
%%%%
book of transfigurations

An advanced book of Transmutations spells, written on constantly changing
material. At any given moment, a sorcerer could be reading words written on
paper, silk, stone, parchment, etched glass, wool, metal foil, snakeskin,
velvet, or a thousand other things.
%%%%
book of unlife

This unholy book describes a variety of magical methods for the creation and
command of undead servants. The dreadful book radiates a malignant aura, and
its parchment pages sometimes twitch and shudder on their own.
%%%%
book of war chants

A book of spells helpful for a warrior. The versions contained here have a
musical form, following the traditions of fighting skalds. Functionally,
though, they work the same as spells whose magic words are merely spoken.
%%%%
book of wizardry

A book of various magic spells, useful for any sufficiently-talented
spellcaster. Mages of a scholarly nature consider it a point of pride to have
contributed in some way to this work, though more than a few of them have been
slain by jealous rivals using their own spells against them.

crescent head. It can inflict grievous wounds, but is cumbersome to manoeuvre
with just one hand due to its length and weight.

A heavy piece of wood, with a place to grip on one end and most of its weight

very popular and effective means of dispute resolution.
%%%%
corpse

A corpse. You can butcher it to produce edible meat chunks.
%%%%
crossbow

A piece of machinery, used for firing bolts, which takes some time to load and
fire. It does very good damage in combat.
%%%%
crystal ball of energy

A magical device which can be used to restore one's reserves of magical energy,

find this item most beneficial.
%%%%
crystal plate armour

An incredibly heavy but extremely effective suit of crystalline armour.
%%%%
dagger

A double-edged fighting knife with a sharp point that can be thrown from afar.

grand grimoire

A deathly silence seems to surround this book as it's opened; even the very air
appears to recoil from the monstrosities pictured here. The pages, covered in

souls, however, who have toyed with this tome and been driven mad by eldritch
horrors from beyond imagining.

great mace

sustained, and can be redirected to new targets by evoking the rod in

%%%%
quick blade

This carefully wrought short sword is preternaturally well-balanced, making it
much easier for even inexperienced handlers to attack with it quickly. Not many
swordsmiths have the requisite skill to make one, so they are only produced in
small numbers, and are difficult to find.
%%%%
rambutan

A small but delicious tropical fruit. How it got into this dungeon is anyone's
guess.
%%%%

%%%%
ring of teleportation

This ring occasionally exerts its power to randomly translocate its wearer to
another place, and can be deliberately activated for the same effect.
%%%%
ring of wizardry

This ring increases the ability of its wearer to use magical spells.
%%%%
robe

A large, loose-fitting, wide-sleeved outer garment made of light cloth. Robes

armour and bardings which can be enchanted up to the same value as their base
AC.

It can also be used to enchant the hides of certain exotic creatures.
%%%%
scroll of enchant weapon i

This scroll places an enchantment on the wielded weapon, making it more
accurate in combat. It becomes increasingly less likely to succeed when used on
highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them up to +9. Magical
artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
%%%%
scroll of enchant weapon ii

This scroll places an enchantment on the wielded weapon, making it inflict
greater damage in combat. It becomes increasingly less likely to succeed when
used on highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them up to +9.
Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
%%%%
scroll of enchant weapon iii

This scroll enchants the wielded weapon to be far more effective in combat,
increasing both accuracy and damage. It becomes increasingly less likely to
succeed when used on highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them
up to +9. Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
%%%%
scroll of fear

This scroll causes great fear in those who see the one who reads it.
%%%%

If used on a deck of cards, this scroll will also give away the top card.
%%%%

violently when the scroll is opened and read, scorching the reader and anything
else nearby.
%%%%
scroll of magic mapping

This scroll reveals the surroundings of the one who reads it.
%%%%

This prank scroll, often slipped into a wizard's backpack by a devious
apprentice, causes a loud noise. It is not otherwise noted for its usefulness.

It is easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of this scroll by the
sense of achievement you get from getting it to work at all.
%%%%
scroll of recharging

reader. When used on a rod, it also increases the size of the rod's power
storage, increases the rate at which it regenerates power, and even improves
its melee combat qualities.

Reading this scroll removes curses from the items you are using.
%%%%
scroll of unholy creation

This scroll draws unformed lumps of flesh from the Abyss to create a terrible
beast.
%%%%

scroll of torment

This scroll calls on the powers of darkness to inflict great pain on any nearby
creature — including you! This halves the resilience of all living creatures,
although is never directly fatal.
%%%%
scroll of vorpalise weapon

This scroll enchants the wielded weapon so as to make it far more effective at
inflicting harm on its wielder's enemies. Using it on a weapon already affected
by some kind of permanent branding is not advised. On the other hand, the
scroll can make permanent the temporary branding of weapons obtained from some
spells.

Brands that are closely tied to one of the gods (Trog, Lugonu, Kikubaaquadgha,
the Shining One) cannot be affixed this way. Xom, on the other hand, wouldn't
let such an opportunity for fun go to waste.
%%%%
scroll of vulnerability

This scroll cancels all magical enchantments from the reader and from beings in
the vicinity. Also, the magical resistances of the reader and nearby beings are
halved for a short duration. The latter effect does not apply to beings fully
immune to magic.
%%%%
scroll of silence

This scroll eliminates all sound near the reader. This makes reading scrolls,
casting spells, praying or yelling in the reader's vicinity impossible. (It
applies to the reader, too, of course.)

This silence will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural
effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very
wrong. Silence starts out with a radius covering half the normal vision range,
which will then shrink, eventually covering only the reader, before the effect
times out.

Note that demons do not need sound to cast spells; certain necromantic fixtures
have this property as well.
%%%%
scythe

A farm implement, usually only used by untrained mobs in combat.
%%%%
shield

A piece of wood and metal, to be strapped on one arm for defence. It is
cumbersome to wear, and, without training, slows the rate at which a warrior

weapon is often found in the hands of those who wish to stab their foes
unaware.

%%%%
slice of pizza

A slice of pizza: a flatbread with tomato sauce, mozzarella di bufala, and
basil.
%%%%

A piece of cloth and leather for launching stones, which do a small amount of
damage on impact. Unlike with other launchers, wearing a shield does not slow
down its rate of fire.

effective as ammunition than simple stones.
%%%%
snozzcumber

A repulsive cucumber-shaped vegetable.
%%%%

head fastened on one end. Shorter than other polearms, it can be wielded with

head.
%%%%

attached lengthwise to a thick leather backing. While offering great

own purposes.
%%%%

%%%%
staff of conjuration

This staff increases the power of conjurations cast by its wielder.
%%%%
staff of death

This staff increases the power of necromantic spells cast by its wielder, and
protects him or her from negative energy. If the wielder is skilled in both
evocations and necromancy, they can inflict great pain on those living souls
they strike.
%%%%
staff of earth

This staff increases the power of earth spells cast by its wielder. If the
wielder is skilled in evocations, it can crush those struck by it, dealing even
greater damage if they are also skilled in earth magic.
%%%%
staff of energy

This staff greatly reduces the hunger cost of the wielder's magical spells.
%%%%
staff of fire

This staff increases the power of fire spells cast by its wielder, and protects
him or her from the effects of heat and fire. If the wielder is skilled in
evocations, they can burn those struck by it, dealing even greater damage if
they are also skilled in fire magic.
%%%%
staff of poison

This staff increases the power of poisoning spells cast by its wielder, and
protects him or her from the effects of poison. If the wielder is skilled in
both evocations and poison magic, they can poison creatures struck by it — even
if the victims were normally resistant.
%%%%
staff of power

This staff provides a reservoir of magical power to its wielder.
%%%%
staff of summoning

This staff increases the power of summonings cast by its wielder, and wards him
or her from the attacks of summoned creatures. If the wielder is skilled in

spells.
%%%%
steam dragon armour

Armour made from the scales of a steam-breathing dragon. Although, unlike
the armour made from the scales of some larger dragons, it does not provide
its wearer with much protection, it is extremely light and as supple as
cloth.
%%%%
steam dragon hide

The soft and supple scaly skin of a steam dragon. It may be turned into proper
armour by magical means.
%%%%
stone

A small chunk of dense but otherwise unremarkable natural mineral. It can be
thrown by hand or launched with a sling.
%%%%
stone of earth elementals

A magical device for summoning earth elementals. It is rather unreliable, and
usually requires several attempts to function correctly. Using it carries an
element of risk, which is reduced if one is skilled in the appropriate
elemental magic, especially when trying to control multiple elementals at the
same time.
%%%%
storm dragon armour

Armour made from the scales of a lightning-breathing dragon. It is heavier
than most dragon scale armours, and gives its wearer great resistance to
electrical discharges.
%%%%
storm dragon hide

The hide of a lightning-breathing dragon, covered in extremely hard blue
scales. In its raw form it does not provide much protection beyond resistance
to electrical discharge, but with magical means it may be used to make
excellent armour.

sultana

A humble raisin.

throwing net

A mesh of ropes knotted together with weights around the edge. Originally used

%%%%
tome of destruction

An extremely powerful but unpredictable book of wild magic. Warning: Reading

%%%%
trident

A fishing spear improved with a longer shaft and a three-pronged metal head. It
can be wielded with one or two hands, but due to the added weight it cannot be
thrown effectively.
%%%%
triple sword

A magical weapon with three great razor-sharp blades. According to legend, a
master forger created a sword with two blades at the facetious suggestion of a
knight, who, finding that the resulting blade was quite functional, jovially
quipped, "Ah, very good, but could you make a *triple* sword?" When the answer
turned out to be yes, the knight was too shocked to ask about the possibilities
of a quadruple sword.
%%%%
trishula

A blessed trident moulded by cleansing flame, with three points symbolising the
combined might of the three holy gods. It is a favoured weapon of the Shining
One's servants.
%%%%

watch as it falls into lava below or you put it out of its misery with your
