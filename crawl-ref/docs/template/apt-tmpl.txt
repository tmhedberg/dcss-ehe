TABLES OF APTITUDES

The following three tables describe all aptitudes of the various species
for the various skills. These are not necessary for winning in Crawl,
neither explicit nor implicit. The qualitative information behind this
sheet (i.e., which species is good at which tasks) can be obtained in
two other, less sophisticated ways:
- Read the species section in the manual about strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at which combinations of species and background are recommended
  (lightgrey).

If you consider figuring out such things yourself to be fun, stop
reading now. Otherwise, just go ahead.

 -5  abysmal aptitude
 -4  terrible aptitude (learning half as fast as at 0 aptitude)
 -3  very poor aptitude
 -2  poor aptitude
 -1  slightly disfavoured aptitude
  0  standard aptitude
 +1  slightly favoured aptitude
 +2  strong aptitude
 +3  very strong aptitude
 +4  outstanding aptitude (learning twice as fast as at 0 aptitude)
 +5  exceptional aptitude

Please note that many things affect how quickly a character will
actually learn a skill. Thus, the numbers below are good enough for
comparisons among species, but not necessarily among skills.

There are three special values: HP, MP and Experience:
- The HP and MP values indicate the percentages of hit points and magic
  points that are gained per level. 0 is the Human standard, -1 is 10%
  fewer points, +1 is 10% more points, etc.
- The Experience value indicates how much experience has to be earned in
  order to gain a new level. +1 is the Human standard, and all other
  species (apart from Halfling and Kobold) are slower. These values use
  the same scale as the skill aptitudes.

The abbreviations used for the skills are:
